- 👋 Hi, I’m @LuisBuelna03
- 👀 I'm interested in embedded systems programming and networks primarily, but I'm also open to web and general app programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data science as it's the specialization of the career I'm pursuing. I believe it's the future of programming.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate with a systems company for my Professional Internship.
- 📫 How to reach me? My email is luisbuelna03@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: "EL BUELNA"
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've learned more about embedded systems programming than data science, even though my career is focused on data science.
